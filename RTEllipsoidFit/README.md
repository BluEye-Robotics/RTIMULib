# RTEllipsoidFit

Elliptic_fit.py is used to generate magCorr.dta. This script is dependent on magRaw.dta, which is generated by the first step in the calibration procedure, min-max of magnetic field.

Execute with 

```python
cd RTIMULib/RTEllipsoidFit
python EllipticFit.py
```

mag_cal.py is used to compare the new calibrated sphere with the old one.

```python
cd RTIMULib/RTEllipsoidFit
python mag_cal.py
```

The created file `magCorr.dta` will now be used by the lib to correct the heading measurements.
